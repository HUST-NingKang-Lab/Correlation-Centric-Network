/*
 * Definitions
 *
 * Vertices have index v, 0<= v < (number vertices).
 *
 * Edges have index e, 0<=e<(number edges) 
 * Each edge has an outgoing stub, index (2e) and incoming stub index (2e+1). 
 * Thus total number of stubs is 2*(number edges).  Note that and exclusive or
 * (s ^1) whill get you from one stub to its partner.  As integer division 
 * drops the remainders e=s/2 is always the edge associated with stub s.
 * While the stub directions have no meaning for undirected graphs it is still 
 * convenient to maintain this convention.  It also means the code is easily 
 * adapted for directed graphs. If the edges are weighted then a vector of 
 * doubles stores the weights so edgeWeight[e]=w weight of edge s and so of 
 * stubs (2e) and (2e+1).
 *
 * The graph is stored using incident matrices.  First the vertex v at the end 
 * of each stub s is listed in the stubToVertex vector.  Thus stubToVertex[s]=v.
 * Secondly each vertex v has a list of incident stubs.  This means each
 * stub has a local index, n (for neighbour), indicating it is the n-th stub 
 * of vertex v.  Thus 0 <= n < k=(degree of vertex v).  This stub has a global 
 * index s and this is what the second incident matrix tells us.  So
 * vertexToStub[v][n]=s.  
 * 
 * Note that for directed graphs there will need to be
 * two vertexToStub lists, one for incoming stubs and one for outgoing stubs.  
 * Its recommended that vertexToStub is used for outgoing and a second one, 
 * vertexToIncomingStub list is used for incoming stubs.
